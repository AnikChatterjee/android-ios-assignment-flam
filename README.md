## About This Assignment

This repository contains my completed solutions for the FLAM assignment, where we were asked to choose and implement two challenges each from the **Android** and **iOS** categories.

I have selected:

- **Android (Kotlin Playground):**
  - Question 1: N Queen Puzzle
  - Question 2: Dependency cycle checker
  - Question 4: Weather Track Simulation
- **iOS (Swift Playground):**
  - Challenge 1: Music Player Service (Design Patterns)
  - Challenge 3: Social Media Feed (MVVM Architecture)

##  Highlights

### Android
- All Android programs were written and tested using **Kotlin Playground**.
- The logic is beginner-friendly and focuses on demonstrating an understanding of basic Kotlin syntax and features.

### iOS
- iOS challenges were focused on **understanding app structure** rather than building complete apps.
- Music Player and Social Media Feed were implemented in Swift using concepts like single-instance design and MVVM architecture.
- I’ve used console output and mock behaviour to simulate features due to the limitations of running full iOS apps online.

## How to View/Run

- **Android (Kotlin):**  
  Open each `.kt` file in [https://play.kotlinlang.org](https://play.kotlinlang.org) and click **Run**.

- **iOS (Swift):**  
  You can view the Swift code using:
  - [https://swiftfiddle.com](https://swiftfiddle.com) (for logic-only)
  - Or open in **Xcode** as a Swift Playground.

## Final Notes

This assignment helped me understand the fundamentals of both Android and iOS development. Although I’m still learning, I’ve done my best to write clean, understandable code and follow the assignment requirements.

Thank you for taking the time to review my submission!
